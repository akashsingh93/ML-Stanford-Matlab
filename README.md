# ML-Stanford-Matlab
Machine Learning Projects as part of Certifications on Machine Learning by Stanford University in Matlab

These are the mini projects of Supervised as well as Unsupervised Machine Learning. Each code has been tested well with the attached dataset. Let me know for any bugs.

Every Project has been done from scratch in matlab which include Hyperparameters tuning except for SVM package.
